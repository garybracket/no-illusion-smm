# No iLLusion SMM (Rails)

A Ruby on Rails freemium SaaS platform for social media management that helps users create and publish content across multiple platforms with optional AI assistance. Built with privacy, transparency, and user empowerment at its core.

## Project Status
üöß **Active Development** - Migration from Next.js/Supabase to Rails architecture

This is a complete rebuild of the existing `social-media-manager` (Next.js + Auth0 + Supabase) into a cleaner Ruby on Rails full-stack application for better maintainability and deployment simplicity.

## Core Values
- **No Games, No Gimmicks**: Transparent pricing and honest feature communication
- **Patient Education**: Bridge the gap between tech complexity and user understanding  
- **Anti-Predatory**: Fight against companies that exploit tech-ignorant small businesses
- **Function Over Form**: Build tools that work first, look pretty second
- **User Choice**: Optional AI assistance - users control their content creation approach

## Freemium Architecture
**Every feature is componentized and tier-gated:**
- **Free Tier**: Basic profile management, limited posts
- **Pro Tier**: LinkedIn sync, AI assistance, analytics  
- **Enterprise Tier**: Multi-platform, advanced AI, white-label

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails 7.1
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Heroku Postgres)
- **Authentication**: Devise + Auth0 integration
- **Frontend**: Rails Views + Stimulus + Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Claude API for content generation
- **Deployment**: Heroku (single app deployment)
- **Background Jobs**: Sidekiq (when needed)

rails test

# Generate migrations
rails generate migration MigrationName
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development
```yaml
# config/database.yml
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: no_illusion_smm_development
  pool: 5
  username: gary
  password: key$1234
  host: localhost
```

### Credentials
```yaml
# config/credentials.yml.enc
ai:
  anthropic:
    api_key: your_claude_api_key

auth0:
  domain: your_auth0_domain
  client_id: your_client_id
  client_secret: your_client_secret

linkedin:
  client_id: your_linkedin_client_id
  client_secret: your_linkedin_client_secret
```

## Deployment (Heroku)
```bash
# Create Heroku app
heroku create no-illusion-smm

# Add PostgreSQL
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:essential-0

# Set environment variables
heroku config:set RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
heroku config:set RAILS_ENV=production

# Deploy
git push heroku main
heroku run rails db:migrate

## Reference Implementation
The original `social-media-manager` project serves as a reference for:
- Feature requirements and user flows
- API integration patterns
- AI prompt template system design
- Database schema concepts (adapted for Rails)
- UI/UX patterns and components

## Current Status
- **Single Platform**: Starting with LinkedIn only
- **Basic Rails Architecture**: Models, controllers, and views established
- **AI Integration**: Claude API service implemented
- **Profile Management**: User profiles with content modes
- **Authentication**: Devise setup with Auth0 preparation

## Privacy-First Architecture
- **No Content Storage**: Content processed and discarded immediately
- **User-Controlled AI**: Users provide their own API keys
- **Transparent Processing**: Full visibility into AI prompts used
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only essential metadata stored
