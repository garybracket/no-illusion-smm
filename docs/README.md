### `no-illusion-business.md`

## Archive

All other documentation files have been moved to `archive/` folder as they are no longer actively used by the application code. They remain available for reference but are not required for the application to function.

**Archived files include:**
- Technical guides (Architecture, Security, Deployment)
- Setup documentation (Auth0, Email, Installation)  
- Historical files (Changes, Requirements, Feature docs)
- Duplicate/legacy content files

## Usage

The application currently reads:
- `skills.md` - For profile setup and skills management
- `no-illusion-business.md` - For branding consistency and company information

All other documentation is for human reference only.
