## Living Document

These values guide every feature decision, design choice, and business practice. They're not marketing copy‚Äîthey're our operational principles.

**Questions we ask before adding any feature:**
- Does this empower users or create dependency?
- Are we being transparent about what this does and doesn't do?
- Does this respect different user preferences and approaches?
- Will this genuinely help small businesses grow?
- Are we building what we're advertising?
